Node.js Server: The heart of my backend is a Node.js server that handles all the data processing and interactions.

Express.js: I use the highly reliable Express.js framework to build APIs and handle routing, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

Database Integration: MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, is integrated with Mongoose for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Authentication and Security: I employ bcrypt for secure password hashing, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, and other security measures to protect your data.

Third-party Services: To enhance functionality, I integrate with services like Cloudinary for image hosting and Stripe for payment processing.

Development and Testing Tools: I use TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest for maintaining code quality and ensuring a seamless development process.

# Frontend

Vite Build: My frontend is built using Vite, a modern and fast build tool, ensuring quick load times and a responsive user experience.

React: I leverage React, the renowned JavaScript library, to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
